Status: No action - let this die a natural patch.
Recommendation: Discard the patch
Background: This looks like the remnants of a patch to me. It alters a custom search to prevent the $justIDS
parameter from working. I originally thought there might be some smart groups using it but then I found this
https://github.com/CiviCRM42/civicrm42-core/commit/e44ebf8dacdb8d6f17d7082c6bcef552fc2bda53
and I think someone made a boo-boo & wmf didn't merge in the boo-boo reversal.

This search shouldn't really make sense from 4.4 onwards as the created_date field is in the contact record from 4.3,
meaning that this search would no longer add much value.
